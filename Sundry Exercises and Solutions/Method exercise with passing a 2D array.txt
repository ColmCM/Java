Write the following program.
(This follows the same pattern as the 1D array example
from yesterday)

1) In the main method declare a 2D array as follows:

int[][] myValues= { {23,38,14,7},
                    {-3, 0,14,4},
                    { 9, 13,0,3}, 
                  };

2) In your main method and write a loop
to print out the current contents of the (myValues) 
array to the screen.

3) Write a separate method, which does not return any
value and takes a single 2D array reference formal 
parameter. 
In the body of this method you will cycle
through each of the individual memory slots
of the 2D array and assign it the value 42;

4)In your main method write code that makes
a call to this newly defined method and pass
to it a previously initialised array (myValues). 

5) In your main method and write a loop
to print out the changed contents of the (myValues) array 
to the screen.
